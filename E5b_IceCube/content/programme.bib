	extends the Scikit-Learn {API} with visual analysis and
	diagnostic tools. The Yellowbrick {API} also wraps Matplotlib to
	create publication-ready figures and interactive data
	explorations while still allowing developers fine-grain control
	of figures. For users, Yellowbrick can help evaluate the
	performance, stability, and predictive value of machine learning
	models, and assist in diagnosing problems throughout the machine
	learning workflow.},
